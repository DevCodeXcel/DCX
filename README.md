# 🎬 About Me

What's up! I’m **Cobin**, a creative dedicated to storytelling and learning. Life has taken unexpected turns, shaping my passion for filmmaking, coding, and community engagement into a vibrant tapestry of experiences. 💪🏾🌞

I’m just a laid-back visionary trying to bring my ideas to life. A long time ago, I was deep into coding, whipping up bot applications for games like StarCraft by Blizzard. Back then, it was all about creativity and having fun with tech. Now, as I face the challenges of losing my vision, I’m more motivated than ever to keep creating and sharing what I love.

These days, I’m focused on learning and adapting to how much coding has changed. I believe creativity doesn’t have limits, and I want to show that through my work. Every project I dive into isn’t just about getting things done; it’s about expressing myself and connecting with folks who vibe with what I’m doing. I’m all about proving that you can still shine, no matter what life throws at you.

As I navigate this journey, I feel a sense of urgency to leave my mark in the tech world. I want to share my story and inspire others to chase their dreams, too. Before my sight fades, I’m determined to be a creative force, showing that being a visionary means rolling with the punches and keeping that spark alive. 

## 🌟 Embracing Change: My Journey of Resilience

Life has a funny way of throwing curveballs at you, and I’ve had my fair share. As I’ve started to lose my vision, I’ve had to face some tough realities, but instead of letting it bring me down, I’m all about embracing the change. It hasn’t been easy, but I’ve learned that resilience isn’t just about bouncing back; it’s about rolling with the punches and finding strength in the struggle. I’m determined to keep pushing forward, finding new ways to express my creativity and vision.

When I look back at my journey, I see a mix of highs and lows, all shaping who I am today. The days of coding those bot applications for StarCraft feel like a lifetime ago, but those experiences still fuel my passion. As everything shifts around me, I’m embracing the chaos and using it to inspire my next moves. I’m all about adapting and figuring out how to make the most out of every situation, even when the road gets rocky.

What I’ve realized is that resilience isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a lifestyle. It’s about keeping a cool head and staying true to myself, no matter what challenges come my way. I’m here to prove that it’s okay to be vulnerable while still standing tall. As I navigate this new chapter, I’m excited to see where my journey takes me and ready to inspire others to embrace their own changes, too. 

## 🎥 Filmmaking: Capturing Life's Moments

Losing someone close made me see things differently, and that's what pushed me to pick up a camera. I needed a way to hold on to those moments that slip away too fast. Filmmaking gave me that chance, letting me capture the raw, real side of life. It became more than a hobby—it turned into my way of dealing with pain and finding beauty in everything, even the hard stuff.

Every time I shoot, it’s about telling a story that means something. I don’t just want to record what’s happening; I want to capture the emotion behind it. Whether it’s the quiet moments or the loud, joyful ones, each frame helps me hold onto the feelings that come with them. Through filmmaking, I’ve learned to slow down, appreciate what’s in front of me, and create something that lasts.

To me, filmmaking is about making sure those memories never fade. It’s not just about what’s seen through the lens; it’s about what’s felt. My goal is to inspire others to capture their own stories and remind themselves that every moment, even the tough ones, deserves to be remembered. After all, it’s those moments that make life what it is, and they’re worth holding on to.

## 💻 Coding: The Birth of DevCodeXcel

Man, let me tell you, my mind is a whirlwind of ideas when it comes to coding! I’ve dreamt of creating my own Netflix, adding some seriously cool features to apps we already use, and so much more. The possibilities are endless, but for the longest time, I just couldn’t figure out where to start. It felt like I had this treasure chest of creativity locked away because, while I can read code, writing it independently was like staring at a blank page—overwhelming and a little intimidating.

That’s when I decided to give myself a kick in the rear and jump into the world of coding headfirst. I’m diving into freeCodeCamp with a goal to earn all 15 certificates, and trust me, I’m excited about the journey ahead. It’s about more than just learning to code; it’s about unlocking my potential and finally bringing those wild ideas to life. Each certificate is a stepping stone, and I’m ready to soak up all the knowledge I can get.

Starting this journey as DevCodeXcel feels like the beginning of something huge. I’m all about turning those ideas into reality and proving that you can start from anywhere, no matter your background. It’s about getting my hands dirty, making mistakes, and learning along the way. I can’t wait to see where this adventure takes me and how I can inspire others to dive into coding and chase their dreams, too. Let’s get it!
## 🔴 Live Coding Sessions On Twitch!

Streaming live coding is my way of tracking my journey as a developer while sharing the experience with all of you.

I want you to roll with me on this adventure over at https://twitch.tv/devcodexcel and be part of the fun!
