<h1 align="left">🪲 About DCX (DevCodeXcel)</h1>



<h5 align="left">Welcome to DCX! I’m Cobin Blair, the founder and creative director of DevCodeXcel. DCX isn’t just a brand—it’s a reflection of my journey and a testament to perseverance in the face of adversity. What started as a passion for design has evolved into a mission to create impactful digital experiences and inspire others through technology.</h5>


<h1 align="left">📙 The Story Behind DCX</h1>


<p align="left">After spending over 15 years as a graphic designer, I began losing my peripheral vision due to a combination of glaucoma and severe blepharitis. As my sight deteriorated, I was faced with two choices: allow this obstacle to define my future or channel my creative energy into something that would transcend my vision. That’s when DCX (DevCodeXcel) was born.<br><br>I shifted my focus from traditional design to coding and development, exploring new ways to bring my ideas to life through technology. While my eyesight may be fading, my vision for what DCX can achieve is clearer than ever. I embraced this challenge not as a limitation but as a driving force to excel in areas that can have a lasting impact.<br><br>The name DevCodeXcel reflects my commitment to development, coding, and the relentless pursuit of excellence. The Alien Cat Logo symbolizes thinking beyond the ordinary—representing adaptability, curiosity, and an unconventional approach to problem-solving. It’s a reminder that creativity and resilience can thrive under any circumstances, and that innovation isn’t limited by physical constraints.</p>


<h2 align="right">Why the Alien Cat Logo? 😺👽</h2>



<p align="left">The Alien Cat Logo? Yeah, it’s pretty unique, right? I wanted a symbol that represents thinking outside the box and being a bit unconventional. It’s a fusion of my love for minimalistic design, sci-fi aesthetics, and a hint of playfulness. Like me, this logo can be serious when it needs to be, but it also loves to show its quirky side.</p>
